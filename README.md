### Technologies (Update this list)
* Python (99% of the time)
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for our virtual environments
* Pandas for working with data (99% of the time)
* Google Colab for sharing examples
* Plotly for visualization
* Pytest for testing
* Travis for continuous integration testing
* Black for code style
* Flake8 for linting
* [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for documentation
* Numpy docstring format
* pre-commit for githooks

## Getting Started with the Conda Virtual Environment
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). CAUTION for python virtual env users: Anaconda will automatically update your .bash_profile
so that conda is launched automatically when you open a terminal. You can deactivate with the command `conda deactivate`
or you can edit your bash_profile.
2. If you are new to [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/)
check out their getting started docs.
3. If you want the pre-commit githooks to install automatically, then following these
[directions](https://pre-commit.com/#automatically-enabling-pre-commit-on-repositories).
4. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
5. In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you cloned this repo.
6. Run `conda update -n base -c defaults conda` to update to the latest version of conda
7. Run `conda env create -f conda-environment.yml --name [input-your-env-name-here]`. This will download all of the package dependencies
and install them in a conda (python) virtual environment. (Insert your conda env name in the brackets. Do not include the brackets)
8. Run `conda env list` to get a list of conda environments and select the environment
that was created from the environmental.yml file (hint: environment name is at the top of the file)
9. Run `conda activate <conda-env-name>` or `source activate <conda-env-name>` to start the environment.
10. If you did not setup your global git-template to automatically install the pre-commit githooks, then
run `pre-commit install` to enable the githooks.
11. Run `deactivate` to stop the environment.

## Getting Started with this project
1. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.
(If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)
2. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
3. (Finishing filling out this list)

## Contributing Guide
1. All are welcome to contribute to this project.
1. Naming convention for notebooks is
`[short_description]-[initials]-[date_created]-[version]`,
e.g. `initial_data_exploration-jqp-2020-04-25-v-0-1-0.ipynb`.
A short `_` delimited description, the creator's initials, date of creation, and a version number,
1. Naming convention for data files, figures, and tables is
`[PHI (if applicable)]-[short_description]-[date created or downloaded]-[code_version]`,
e.g. `raw_project_data_from_mnist-2020-04-25-v-0-1-0.csv`,
or `project_data_figure-2020-04-25-v-0-1-0.png`.

NOTE: PHI data is never stored in github and the .gitignore file includes this requirement as well.
